# quotely
Google Chrome extension to show inspirational quotes for the day.

First sign up for an api key here
https://www.pexels.com/api/

These are the commands for the npm modules if needed
- npm i pexels
- npm i --D webpack webpack-cli
- npm i --D copy-webpack-plugin
- npm i randomquote-api
- npm install --save-dev @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env

Then you will need to replace your api key in the popup.js file 
Then your google chrome extension should work if you upload it to chrome://extensions/
